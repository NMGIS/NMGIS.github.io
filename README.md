## Portfolio Notes
### Can I add a blog, etc?
This template works best for simple sites. For a blog you can try setting up [Jekyll, which is a static site generator that also works on Github pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). For even more functionality, you will probably need a content management system (CMS) such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com), [Drupal](http://drupal.org), or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com). A CMS will require additional setup and a website host, such as [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/). 


### Can I make separate HTML files for each page?
You can use Javascript AJAX calls to pull in external content into your index.html page. See script.js for more details.
