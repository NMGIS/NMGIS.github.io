								<h2>Data & Methods</h2>
								<p><a href="https://my.spokanecity.org/police/prevention/compstat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Spokane CompStat Reports</a> - The Spokane Police Departmnent releases weekly CompStat reports which display crime rates within: The entire city, service areas, and districts. Available statistics include summation and percent change over 7 day, 28 day and YTD date ranges. The data in these reports represent preliminary counts of selected crime categories from police case reports. Full statistical analysis to determine the confidence level of this data has not been performed. The % change columns on the preliminary counts differ from the percentage change on the NIBRS crime reports sometimes significantly. The CompStat report is designed for operational use and includes only selected NIBRS categories and coding less complex than full NIBRS rules. Official statistics for these and other NIBRS categories can	be found on WASPC & FBI websites once available. </p>
								<p><pre></pre>The application contains 4 pages and 2 sub-pages:<br>
								    1. <b>Crime per capita (CPC)</b> - Calculated extrenally (not included in CompStat report). 2010 Census data was used and will be updated to 2021 data once available. A color gradient was applied to the districts symbology to assist with a visual comparison of the CPC between districts. Where: Blue = Low CPC and Red = High CPC<br>
									2. <b>Percent change</b> - Displays YTD percent change values (2020 vs 2021) generated in the CompStat report. A color gradient was applied to the districts symbology to assist with a visual comparison of the percent change. Where: green = less crime in 2021, yellow = the same amount of crime, and red = more crime in 2021. <br>
									&emsp;a. <b>Percent change violent crime</b> - Displays YTD violent crime percent change values (2020 vs 2021) generated in the CompStat report. Uses same color gradient described above.<br>
									&emsp;b. <b>Percent change property crime</b> - Displays YTD property crime percent change values (2020 vs 2021) generated in the CompStat report. Uses same color gradient described above.<br>
									3. <b>Violent crime</b> - Raw numbers of violent crime within each district. A color gradient was applied to assist with a visual comparison of the violent crime between districts. Where: White = Low Crime, Red = High Crime<br>
									4. <b>Property crime</b>- Raw numbers of property crime within each district. A color gradient was applied to assist with a visual comparison of the violent crime between districts. Where: White = Low Crime, Red = High Crime<br>
									5. <b>All crime</b> - - Raw numbers of all crime within each district. A color gradient was applied to assist with a visual comparison of the violent crime between districts. Where: White = Low Crime, Red = High Crime</p>
								<h2>Discussion </h2>
								<p>While crime statistics may be alarming at first glance, a comparison of a similar sized city would be helpful. Spokane's Violent crime has increased in 2021 while property crimes have decreased. Larceny predominatly increase the overall crime totals of the CompStat report. A breakdown of these Larceny charges would be helpful and may be found within NIBRS data.</p>
								<p> South of the Spokane river and I-90 appear to be the "safest" districts within the city. Neva-Wood and Northeast appear to be the most "dangerous". While downtown frequently appears to be the most dangerous, it can be considered an anomoly due to it's small full-time living population and high short-term tourist/working population.</p>
