        <ul>
            <li>How is the data geographically distributed? - This data displays the geographic point location of incidents. Incidents occur on roadways and are more frequent in urban areas.</li>
            <li>How is the data temporally distributed? - To understand this, I used ArcGIS Pro's visualize statistics tool. 2012 and late 2023 excluded due to incomplete data; minor dip in 2020 noted. See images below.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <h3>STEP 2: Subset Data | Geographic and Temporal</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data limited to Ada and Canyon counties using spatial selection. Incomplete years removed with attribute queries.</li>
        <ul/>

        <h3>STEP 3: Create Space   Time Cube | Parameters</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Step:</strong> 1-month intervals for granularity and significance.</li>
            <li><strong>Distance Interval:</strong> 330 feet (approximate block length).</li>

        <h3>STEP 5: Emerging Hot Spot Analysis | Parameters</h3>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Neighbors:</strong> 15 spatial, 48 time steps (4 years).</li>
            <li><strong>Clustering:</strong> Strong negative Z-score, significant p-value from ANN test.</li>
